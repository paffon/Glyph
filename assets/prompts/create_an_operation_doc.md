# Your mission

Plan the creation of a new operation document for step <step_to_create_doc_for> from <design_log_name>.

## Instructions

- First read the glyph rules; then:
- Read the operation document guidelines; and finally:
- write the creation plan for the operation document.

The operation document's Background section must be comprehensive, exhaustive and detailed- Taking all of the relevant information from the design log you can find (anywhere in the design log, not just the step itself). The Background section is encouraged to include mermaid charts where appropriate (glyph's mermaid tool can advise on this).

## Before you create the doc

1. Prove you read through the design log doc and understood what relevant information is there for the operation doc.
2. Prove you read through the operation document guidelines and understood them, showing me how you will apply them.
3. You'll keep it SOLID, DRY and Simple.
4. Tell me how many phases and tasks in each phase you plan to have in the operation doc.
